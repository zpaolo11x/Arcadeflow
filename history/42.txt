Introduced different styles for the scrollbar: 
- Scrollbar is a simple scrollbar as before
- Timeline adds ticks and labels depending on the sorting order
- Labels List is a simple list of labels without the actual scrollbar
Changed what happens when you go "down" from the tiles list:
- In "Scrollbar" mode "page jump" is enabled, as usual, skipping entire screens instead of one game
- In "Label List" mode you jump to the next or previous label (letter or year depending on the sorting)
- In "Timeline" mode you jump pages when the scrollbar is highlighted but if you go down again you can jump labels
