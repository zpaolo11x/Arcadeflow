1.9 - 25 July 2018 - http://www.mixandmatch.it/AF/layouts/Arcadeflow_19.zip
AM 2.4 was released while coding AF 1.9, adapted the code so it works both in 2.3 and 2.4:
- Fixed the zorder management
- Implemented a new way to crop thumbnails for "square" thumbs layout
- 2.4 users can access the "Layout Options" menu directly from the "General" menu accessible going "Up" from the game grid
- Rewritten the scrolling title routine with proper timing
Custom background picture is not stretched but scaled/cropped to fit the theme aspect ratio
Thoroughly rewritten the transition response routine, it's cleaner and works much better now.
Thanks to the above rewrite you can now use "left" and "right" on the History screen to go to the previous/next game, the layout should now respond correctly even to "jump to letter" calls and page jumps.
"Square" thumbnails layout now responds to the "Blurred Logo Shadow" option, if you enable it you'll get game name overlay with drop shadow, otherwise plain game name with gradient background.
When a game has a multi-language title separated by "/" (e.g. Fatal Fury / Garou Densetsu) the theme will crossfade the titles so that title scrolling is needed less often.
