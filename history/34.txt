Custom control button not needed anymore, now when you hit "select" on a game you'll see the context menu, if you hit "select" again the game will play, otherwise you can use arrows as before for different functions
Revised the context menu graphics
Changed the way "color gradient" is calculated: instead of sampling some points on the image it uses an actual smoothed version of the image
Changed the way "glow color" is calculated, takes its color from actual thumbnail (static or video) isntead of the average as before
Added glowing effect in history page around the game display video
