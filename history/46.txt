Box art mode for consoles is now "Box Art - Flyer Mode" and can be enabled for all displays and emulators by default
Each display can be switched from Box Art to Flyer on the fly using a menu or a hot button, this is persistent
Ditched "Console, Arcade, Handheld" distinction in favor of automatic LCD sensing. Just set you emulator System Identifier accordingly, so you can have "Game Boy" or even "gameboy" or "Game Gear" etc and the system will react.
LCD games are now rendered with the title popping out, unless "Square" mode is set in the theme options.
Custom shader for LCD games, different from CRT shader, there's now a "native resolution" table inside Arcadeflow so pixels effects and scanlines are rendered correctly even on stretched snapshots
New unified tiles display routine allows the mix of different screen orientation or box art orientation in the same display, so if you have a romlist with Genesis, Snes and Game Boy games all together the system will adapt each artowrk (screenshot or boxart) accordingly
Games with squarish screen or non 4:3 apect ratios will be cropped accordingly if the system identifier is LCD, games with CRT identifier will be stretched to 4:3 1:1 or 3:4 (to compensate pixel aspect ratio)
Boxart mode can be configured in theme option, but also changed on the fly with a general menu entry or with a custom control button (no layout reload required)
When using the "Default" Displays Menu the layout doesn't need to reload at display changes. This is still needed when using Arcadeflow as Displays Menu Layout
Overlayed videos now fade out instead of just disappearing when changing tile
If you have a System Identifier defined it will be shown after the ROM main name, before the ROM name details.
