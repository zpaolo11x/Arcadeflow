Changed the way horizontal and vertical games are detected, this time it should work for all users and all games lists
Changed the way the "vertical" mode is scaled and layed out, clearer and with larger thumbs 
Search features that require tex input now also work with on-screen keys (embedded the KeyboardSearch plugin)
New theme options included: 
- "Search string entry method" to chose if you want to use a keyboard or a joystick and on screen keys to enter text
- "Immediate search" will live update results while you enter search text using the on screen keys
- "Enable AF splash logo" enables/disables the fading splash Arcadeflow logo
- "Vertical rows" allows to use 2 or 3 rows of icons in vertical mode
