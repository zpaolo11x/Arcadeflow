Introduced new options for the displays menu list:
- List can be a simple displays name list, or it can show artwork from the menu-art folder
- If there's no artwork for a displays name Arcadeflow can geerate proper artwork from the system name (system logo) of from the display name using a nice font
- Instead of a plain text list for displays names you can have a list with system logos generated by Arcadeflow
Added an option to show the system logo instead of system name under the game title
