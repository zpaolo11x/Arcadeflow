1.7
Overhauled the menu and functions system, now it works like this:
- When going "UP" from the tiles list you get to a "main menu" where you can select Filters Menu or Global Search
- When on a game using the configurable control button you get a "context menu" overlay with 4 game-specific functions you chose by using your joystick/keys:
  - "UP" enters the "More of the same..." search menu
  - "DOWN" enters the "History" page where you can see and scroll the game history and see a larger game preview
  - "LEFT" to enter the Tags menu
  - "RIGHT" to add/remove favorites
Implemented a version of the History.dat plugin so you can see history without the need to enable the plugin (see options)
Rolled back the way horizontal and vertical games are detected, the "new" one had some issues in many circumstances
Tweaked and updated search with on-screen keys
Added a workaround when invoking filters through the filters menu button to fix some tiles update
New theme options included: 
- "History.dat" is the location of the History.dat file (no need to enable or configure the )
- "Index Clones" works like the same option in the History.dat plugin.
- "Generate Index" a one-time function to generate the history index
