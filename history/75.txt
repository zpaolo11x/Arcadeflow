7.5 - 23 April 2020 - http://www.mixandmatch.it/AF/layouts/Arcadeflow_75.zip
Added custom button option for search menu
You can call the options menu from everywhere in the layout
Displays images shown also when categorized menu is selected
Add #console #arcade #handheld #computer or #other to force your display in a category
Very preliminary support for videos in the displays list with images
New menu fade routine
Arcadeflow adapts effects speed to your system framerate, so lower systems won't run slower, just less smooth
Better menu shading when "No frosted glass" is selected
In menus, use "left" to jump to the top of the list
