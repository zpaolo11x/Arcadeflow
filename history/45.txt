4.5 - 24 May 2019 - http://www.mixandmatch.it/AF/layouts/Arcadeflow_45.zip
The layout is not restricted to arcade games anymore, it works and adapts to console games (TV) and handheld games. Just add "Console" and/or "Handheld" to your emulator category in Attract Mode settings
Added a "Box Art Mode" for console games: Arcadeflow won't show screenshots but box artwork for console games. You can enable it from the menu and it will be applied to emulators that have "Console" added as a category.
Optimized layout and CRT filters for handheld games, this is enabled when an emulator have "Handheld" as a category.
Rearrenged the Displays Menu functionality so that now you can use the same Arcadeflow layout for both Displays Menu and normal layout, no need for duplicate folders anymore
Removed "Displays Menu mode" option, now the theme autodetects if it's in Displays Menu mode or not
Added options to change the number of rows when Arcadeflow is used as Displays Menu
Changed parts of the layout so it better copes with console game lists, now it works fine with screenshots for TV consoles (4:3 screen aspect ratio)
