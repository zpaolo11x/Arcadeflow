3.6
Arcadeflow 3.6 requires Attract Mode 2.5.
Fixed some issues with AM 2.5 when adding or deleting favorites and tags.
Changed the CRT filter in history page from cgwg shader to lotte shader, now scanlines are vertical for vertical games and aligned to the game actual pixels.
Added options for history page that halves or removes scanlines so the moiree effect is less prominent.
