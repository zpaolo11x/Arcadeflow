The theme may be a bit slower on your system depending on the size of artworks which is generally larger than xnview generated blurred pictures.
- If you have issues with the new way "blur" is generated you can use the layout_noshader.nut file instead, just chose it from the layout options menu (AM 2.4) or rename it to layout.nut (AM 2.3).

- "Square" thumbnails layout now responds to the "Blurred Logo Shadow" option, if you enable it you'll get game name overlay with drop shadow, otherwise plain game name with gradient background.
- When a game has a multi-language title separated by "/" (e.g. Fatal Fury / Garou Densetsu) the theme will crossfade the titles so that title scrolling is needed less often.

*v 1.8*

- Introduced a new layout style where game snaps are not horizontal or vertical depending on game orientation, but cropped square. You can chose it in the options menu.

*v 1.7*

- Overhauled the menu and functions system, now it works like this:
