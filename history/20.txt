2.0 - 17 August 2018 - http://www.mixandmatch.it/AF/layouts/Arcadeflow_20.zip
New feature: you can now change the splash logo
New feature: background artwork can be a semi-transparent PNG and will show the blurred background behind it
Under the hood changes: version 2.0 is a huge rewrite of AF, no need to generate blurred backgrounds or blurred logo shadows with xnview, the theme can generate on the fly shadows and backgrounds from your snapshots and wheel artwork. The theme may be a bit slower on your system depending on the size of artworks which is generally larger than xnview generated blurred pictures.
If you have issues with the new way "blur" is generated you can use the layout_noshader.nut file instead, just chose it from the layout options menu (AM 2.4) or rename it to layout.nut (AM 2.3). This layout file has all the features of the new one, but in a standard framework using xnview generated artwork
