New option to enable Low Resolution mode
Changed the zooming code of the tiles to avoid jumps and make it smoother, now all tiles zoom out and not just the last one
Fixed the update routine when tags are changed
Changed the way horizontal and vertical games are recognized and the way horizontal and vertical artwork (borders, glows etc) are generated, to reduce layering
