Fixed some bugs in the signal response code and sound management
Added a "fade from black" effect when launching the layout
Revised attract mode:
- Attract mode is now on by default but not at startup, just after the delay
- Streamlined the code, improved performance when it's enabled but not running
- Added black crossfade when changing games
- New options: chose wether attract mode satrts with the layout, only after delay time, or is disabled
- Game rendering is done with a fixed number of scanlines (180) for every game
- For lower resolution screens the number of pixels per scanline is optimized to avoid moiree
- You can now add a sound file to play during attract mode
- Added an option in the general menu to manually start attract mode without waiting
